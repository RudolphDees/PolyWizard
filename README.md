# PolyWizard
A roguelite/roguelike top down 2D adventure game.


# Goal
I am making this to work on my C# skills, experiment with game design, and because I enjoy it.

# Inspiration
I made this after playing Hades and Halls of Torment. I have always enjoyed Roguelite games and find them to be an easy format to begin game developement on.
